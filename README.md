## üöÄ Overview

The **Gesture-Based Geometry Problem Solver** is an interactive web application that allows users to draw geometric shapes using hand gestures and solves mathematical problems related to these shapes in real-time. Using computer vision and AI, the application recognizes shapes, mathematical operators, and numerals drawn in the air, making math learning intuitive and engaging.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Real-time hand tracking** using MediaPipe
- **Shape recognition** for triangles, squares, rectangles, circles, and more
- **Automatic problem solving** with detailed step-by-step solutions
- **Interactive UI** with real-time feedback
- **Gesture controls:**
  - Draw with index finger
  - Hold/confirm shapes with index + middle fingers
  - Clear canvas and solve problems with on-screen buttons

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Socket.IO
- **Backend**: Flask, Flask-SocketIO
- **Computer Vision**: MediaPipe, OpenCV
- **Shape Analysis**: Shapely, NumPy
- **AI Solution Generation**: Groq AI API (deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b)

## üîß Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Webcam
- Internet connection (for Groq API access)

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/gesture-geometry-solver.git
   cd gesture-geometry-solver
   ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment** (optional but recommended)
   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # On Windows: env\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set up your Groq API key**
   - Get your API key from [Groq](https://console.groq.com)
   - Replace the placeholder API key in the code or set as environment variable:
   ```bash
   export GROQ_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
   ```

5. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

6. **Open in browser**
   - Navigate to `http://localhost:5000` in your web browser

## üìù Usage Guide

1. **Start the camera** by clicking the "Start Camera" button
2. **Draw shapes** with your index finger
3. **Confirm shapes** by extending both your index and middle finger
4. **Clear the canvas** with the "Clear Canvas" button when needed
5. **Solve geometry problems** by clicking the "Solve Problem" button
6. **View the solution** in the right panel

## üìä Supported Shapes and Problems

- **Basic Shapes**: Triangles, squares, rectangles, circles, pentagons, hexagons
- **Special Triangles**: Equilateral, right triangles
- **Calculations**: Area, perimeter/circumference, side lengths, diagonals

## üîç How It Works

1. **Hand Tracking**: MediaPipe identifies hand landmarks in real-time
2. **Gesture Recognition**: The system identifies drawing vs. holding gestures
3. **Shape Analysis**: OpenCV and Shapely analyze the drawn points to identify shapes
4. **Problem Formulation**: Detected shapes are analyzed to formulate geometric problems
5. **Solution Generation**: Groq API processes the problem and generates step-by-step solutions
6. **Real-time Feedback**: Socket.IO provides instant updates to the user interface
